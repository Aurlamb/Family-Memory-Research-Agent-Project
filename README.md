# Memory Research Agent Project

🚀 An OCR & Pinecone-Powered Research Agent 🚀  

This project is a multi-module pipeline designed to extract, store, and retrieve data using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and Pinecone Vector Database. It integrates machine learning techniques to enhance memory-based research and retrieval.

## Project Structure

### 1️⃣ MODULE 1 - OCR
📜 Extract text from images and documents using OCR.  
- 🛠 Utilizes Tesseract or an alternative OCR engine.  
- 📄 Processes PDFs, scanned images, and structured data.  
- 📝 Outputs cleaned and structured text for further processing.  

📌 Notebook: `MODULE 1 - OCR.ipynb`

### 2️⃣ MODULE 2 - Pinecone DB Builder
🗄 Stores extracted data into a Pinecone vector database.  
- 🔄 Converts extracted text into embeddings.  
- 🚀 Uses Pinecone as a scalable and efficient vector search database.  
- 🔍 Supports metadata storage for enhanced retrieval.

### 3️⃣ MODULE 3 - Memory Research Agent
💡 An AI-powered research agent for contextual memory retrieval.  

#### There are two versions of this module:
1. ⚙️ MODULE 3 V1 - Complex Code:  
   - 🔬 Advanced architecture with intricate memory handling.  
   - 📚 Handles contextual queries across multiple documents.

2. ✨ MODULE 3 V2 - Simpler Code (Final Version):  
   - 🏎 Optimized and cleaner implementation for easier use.  
   - ⚡ Supports fast and accurate document retrieval.

📌 Notebooks:  
- `MODULE 3 V1 - Memory_research_agent - complex code.ipynb`  
- `MODULE 3 V2 - Memory_research_agent final - simpler code.ipynb`
